// This is called the 0-1 Knapsack problem. You can read more about it here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem
// The premise is that we have a Knapsack (a bag) that can hold a certain amount of weight. 
// We have a set of items that we want to put in the Knapsack. 
// Each item has a weight and a value. We want to maximize the value of the items we put in the Knapsack without exceeding the weight limit.
// Say the weight limit of the Knapsack is W. We have n items. 
// The weight of the i-th item is w[i] and the value of the i-th item is v[i]. 
// We want to find the maximum value of items we can put in the Knapsack without exceeding the weight limit.
