# NOTES for 15th August

* [Site for Practice](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/csawesome/index.html)

* ArrayList is a __Template__ class, which means it requires another class in some fashion for some definition, or maybe some member (varible or method) inside it requires another class (usually a datatype, primitive or user defined) to work properly.

* When working with collections of objects, it is always preferable to use _ArrayLists_ over the traditional _Arrays_ because of the utility functions at our disposal. We can even override/provide definitions for some innate functions (sort, for example) which we can use with ArrayLists.

* Java does not allow _operator overriding_ (look at the python file for an example). We do have a kind of workaround.
