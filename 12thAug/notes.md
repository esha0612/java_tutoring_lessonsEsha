# NOTES for 12th August

* TODO for next week: __Sorting__, __Inheritance__ and __ArrayLists__.

* As long as you do not reassign the array itself, and stick to reassigning members of the array, the changes will be reflected on the original parameter in a call by assignment scenario.

* String reverse is not a function of class _String_, but of the __wrapper__ class _StringBuilder_.
