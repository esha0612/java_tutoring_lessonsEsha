# NOTES for 21st September

* `AND`, `∧` and `U` (union) all represent the same thing. `a ∧ b = 1` __only__ when `a, b = 1`, 0 otherwise.
* `OR`, `∨` and `∩` (intersection) all represent the same thing. `a ∨ b = 0` __only__ when `a, b = 0`, 1 otherwise.
* De Morgan's Laws underline the concept of duality in boolean algebra.
