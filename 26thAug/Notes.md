# NOTES for 26th August

* __Recursion__ is the practice of calling a function from within itself. Once an end case is reached, the control is relinquished to the previous stack (aka the previous instance of that function), all the way up until the topmost function call in the stack.

* Next class: BST, Sorting techniques, pending stuff from 24th August Notes.
